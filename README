All data is in db/*.csv.

Some of it was scraped from web pages, via Ruby scripts in script/scrape/.

All of it can be smushed into an SQLite3 database for serving via script/build_json_db.py. Then server/backend/wsgi_server.py can serve up JSON on demand.

Users will browse to server/web/index.html and enjoy.

== How to run it

You will need Python 3 and a shell to run your own server.

Run `script/build_json_db.py server/backend/names.sqlite3` to compile the CSV files into something server-ready.

Run `cd server/backend; uwsgi --http :8080 -m wsgi_server.py` to run that server on `http://localhost:8080`.

Test the server by checking a URL: `http://localhost:8080/names/montreal/hooper.json`. You should see some JSON, because "hooper" is in the database.

== How to change things

* Edit `server/web/index.html` to change the HTML.
* Edit `server/src/names.coffee` to edit the CoffeeScript source. Download CoffeeScript at http://coffeescript.org, and use it like this: `coffee -w -c -o server/web server/src/names.coffee`. Keep the program running, and it'll update the JavaScript as you write CoffeeScript.
* Edit `server/src/names.scss` to edit the SCSS stylesheet. Download Sass at http://sass-lang.com, and use it like this: `scss --watch server/src/names.scss:server/web/names.css`. Keep the program running, and it'll update the CSS as you write SCSS.
