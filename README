== Project layout

* The project looks like a regular Rails app, but that's just to generate
  the sqlite3 database.
* script/scrape/: contains scripts for downloading CSVs
* db/migrate/: migrations import all those CSVs into an SQLite3 database
* script/export_db.sh: exports the database into a web-server SQLite3 database
* server/web/: files for web server: index.html, names.js, names.php
* server/src/: files used to generate what's in server/web/
